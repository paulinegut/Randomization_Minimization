# Randomization_Minimization

- Minimization is a method of ensuring excellent balance between groups for several prognostic
factors, even in small samples.
- Minimization is a widely acceptable approach.
- Minimization is a form of restricted randomization.
- Minimization is an adaptive randomization type: the treatment allocated to the next partic-
ipant enrolled in the trial depends (wholly or partly) on the characteristics of those participants
already enrolled.
- Minimization is a dynamic method since the randomization list is not produced before the trial
starts, but during participant recruitment.
- Minimization balances treatment assignments across multiple prognostic factors simultaneously.
The aim is that each allocation should minimize the imbalance across multiple factors.
- Minimization has been â€€rst proposed by Taves and independently generalized by Pocock and
Simon.
